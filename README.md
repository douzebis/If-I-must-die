# If-I-must-die

If I must die,\
you must live\
to tell my story\
to sell my things\
to buy a piece of cloth\
and some strings,\
(make it white with a long tail)\
so that a child, somewhere in Gaza\
while looking heaven in the eye\
awaiting his dad who left in a blaze—\
and bid no one farewell\
not even to his flesh\
not even to himself—\
sees the kite, my kite you made, flying up above\
and thinks for a moment an angel is there\
bringing back love\
If I must die\
let it bring hope\
let it be a tale
